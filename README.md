# Manga-Tag-Program
# This is a small program I write to add tags to each manga stored in my computer, making it easy to know what it is all about.
# As I was writing this, I learned much about packages like tkinter, os, PIL, tempfile, zipfile and so on.
# Although I guess there are other simpler ways to do this tagging stuff, it's still a good practice.

# Update Ver 0.50
# Function: 1. Find .zip files recursively in directories
#           2. Open any .zip files to view images
#           3. Attach tags to .zip files and modify tags
#           4. Search all files with a certain tag.
